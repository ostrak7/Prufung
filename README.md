Software Lifecycle Management
Hamming weight
Your client wants you to write an API that calculates the Hamming weight of a number. The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from zero. E.g., 01234→4, 012012→4, 000050000→1. The API should also save the last string and should be able to return it (since the application was (re)started, no need to use a database).
Project
You should implement a REST-based server in Java (use Spring Boot). The service should be able to return the desired information using REST.
Requirements
Use GitHub for the project and follow the correct SLM procedure. Use a Kanban board to manage your User Stories and use a git branching model to manage your code. Track your development process by updating your Kanban board and write at least one unit tests for every requirement. A Continuous Integration pipeline that produces the finished software artifact should be implemented as well. Document
• the whole process
• the user stories
• the repository URL (mandatory)
• the usage of the software
in a file with explanatory text. Submit the code (including the .git folder and .github files) as a zip file (please put the Docs inside the zip file).
You can use external resources as long as you mark them: “ // taken from: <URL> ”
